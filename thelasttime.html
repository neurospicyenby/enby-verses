We never knew when it was the last time, did we?<br><br>

The last time we hugged someone without thinking.<br>
The last time we stayed up late, talking till dawn, laughing until our sides ached.<br>
The last time we said, “See you later” and truly believed it.<br>
We didn’t realise that was the final goodbye, did we?<br>
Not then. Not in that moment.<br><br>

The last time we wore our favourite jumper, before it unravelled.<br>
The last time we ate at that café, ordered the usual, before it closed for good.<br>
The last time we heard a song and danced like no one was watching,<br>
because the truth is, no one was, except our younger selves.<br>
They were watching, hoping we’d remember.<br><br>

We didn’t realise when we were living those last times.<br>
That last family dinner where every seat was filled.<br>
The last time we saw a friend’s name pop up on our screen,<br>
and answered without hesitation.<br>
Or the last time we played that game we thought we’d always play.<br><br>

The last time we held someone’s hand,<br>
or felt the warmth of their laugh spill over us,<br>
never knowing it would be the last time.<br><br>

Funny how life does that, isn’t it?<br>
Wraps moments in ordinary until they quietly slip away,<br>
until they’re just memories,<br>
tucked into corners of our minds we rarely visit.<br><br>

We chase the firsts,<br>
First love, first job, first adventure<br>
But it’s the last times that catch us off guard.<br>
The final heartbeat of a moment,<br>
gone before we’ve even heard its echo.<br>

Maybe that’s what makes them precious.<br>
The fact that we didn’t know.<br>
We couldn’t know.<br>
And maybe, in that not knowing,<br>
we gave them the space to be perfect.<br><br>

So here’s to the last times,<br>
the ones we didn’t recognise.<br>
For living so quietly,<br>
for leaving so softly.<br>
And for reminding us,<br>
that every moment deserves to be cherished.<br>
Because we’ll never know<br>
when it’s the last time.<br>
