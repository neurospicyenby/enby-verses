        <h1>Tomboy</h1>
        <div class="published-date">Published: 10th October 2024</div>
        <p>
            I remember a girl from my childhood, Tanya.
            New to our school, an unfamiliar face,
            A tomboy with cropped hair and skinned knees,
            Always daring, always bold.

            She'd say she was a boy, but we were too young,
            Too bound by norms to see the truth beyond the words.
            Tanya, a tomboy they called her,
            But maybe Tanya wasn't Tanya.

            Years passed, and we drifted apart,
            Separate paths, losing touch.
            She fell into the shadow—drugs, they said,
            The solace of the lost.

            And then the final blow—overdose, gone.
            A life snuffed out, potential unfulfilled.
            Looking back, I wonder,
            Was Tanya really Tanya? Was she always him,
            A boy trapped, unseen, unheard?

            I mourn for him now, for the life he could have had,
            If only we had seen, if only we had heard.
            Tanya, not a tomboy, but a boy named...

            I mourn the loss of a friend,
            The truth hidden beneath labels,
            A boy who was always there,
            A boy who could have thrived.
